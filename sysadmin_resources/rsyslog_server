To configure rsyslog server on Ubuntu to receive and sort remote log messages, follow these steps:

1. Install rsyslog on the Ubuntu server if it is not already installed:
`
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rsyslog
`

2. Edit the rsyslog configuration file to enable receiving remote log messages:
`
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
`

Uncomment the following lines by removing the "#" at the beginning of each line:
`
# provides UDP syslog reception
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")

# provides TCP syslog reception
module(load="imtcp")
input(type="imtcp" port="514")
`

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart the rsyslog service to apply the changes:
`
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
`

5. Configure firewall rules to allow incoming log messages on port 514 (UDP and TCP).

6. To sort incoming log messages into separate log files based on their source, create a new configuration file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory:
`
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/remote.conf
`

Add the following lines to sort logs from a specific IP address into a separate log file:
`
if $fromhost-ip == 'REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS' then /var/log/remote.log
& stop
`
Replace REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of the remote server sending logs.

7. Save and close the file.

8. Restart the rsyslog service again to apply the new configuration:
`
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
`

Now, your rsyslog server on Ubuntu should be configured to receive and sort remote log messages from specified sources into separate log files.
